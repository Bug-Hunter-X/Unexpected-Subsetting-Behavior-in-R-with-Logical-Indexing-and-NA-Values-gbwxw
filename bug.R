```R
# This code attempts to subset a data frame based on a condition,
# but it produces unexpected results due to how R handles logical indexing.

df <- data.frame(a = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), b = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))

# The condition is intended to select rows where column 'b' is TRUE
subset <- df[df$b == TRUE, ]

# Unexpectedly, this often leads to empty data frames or incorrect subsets,
# depending on the data. 

# Let's try another example with potential NA values which may also lead to issues
df2 <- data.frame(a = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), b = c(TRUE, NA, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))
subset2 <- df2[df2$b == TRUE, ]
